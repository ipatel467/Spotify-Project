## Executive Summary
For this project I mainly wanted to use spotify's API. After getting authorization I began to explore the API and see the different kind of data that was being stored. I pulled 1000 songs from Spotify's Api along with their respective popularity. This column will be very important later on in the expirement.

### Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
I first had to pull the data from Spotify's Api. I first had to pull specific songs along with their popularity and other features. After pulling the song informantion I began to pull the spefic audio features from the song such as danceibility, energy,tempo, etc. 


### Data Cleaning <a name="data_cleaning"></a>

There were some songs that contained N/A for certain columns. I had to drop a certain column because the majority of songs were considered N/A in that column. Overall the data was clean for the most part, and took a minimal amount of time.
