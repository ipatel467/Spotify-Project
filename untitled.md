### Interpreting Results <a name="interpreting_results"></a>

##### R Squared: 0.700
R Squared is a metric that measures how close the data is fitted to the regression line. In other words, the R Squared is a measure of the modelâ€™s "Goodness-of-Fit " to the data. 


##### Spread of the Residuals:  

Residuals are the vertical distance between a data point and the regression line. In other words, the residual is the error that is not explained by the regression line(model).

In the plot above we can see how the residuals are spread out. Looking at the distribution of residuals we can see that they are not evenly spread out. This means that the model does not fully explain the data. This could be due to a few reasons such as not having enough data or not having other features to help predict "Tax Percent GDP".
